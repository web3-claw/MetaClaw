## 📖 Overview

**MetaClaw is an agent that meta-learns and evolves in the wild.**
Just talk to your agent as you normally would — MetaClaw turns every live conversation into a learning signal, enabling the agent to continuously improve through real-world deployment rather than offline training alone.

Under the hood, it places your model behind a proxy that intercepts interactions from your personal agent (OpenClaw, CoPaw, IronClaw, PicoClaw, ZeroClaw, NanoClaw, NemoClaw, or any OpenAI-compatible client), injects relevant skills at each turn, and meta-learns from accumulated experience. For Anthropic-native agents like NanoClaw, MetaClaw also exposes a `/v1/messages` Anthropic-compatible endpoint so the full pipeline works without any agent-side changes. Skills are summarized automatically after each session; with RL enabled, a meta-learning scheduler defers weight updates to idle windows so the agent is never interrupted during active use.

No GPU cluster required. MetaClaw works with any OpenAI-compatible LLM API out of the box, and uses a Tinker-compatible backend for cloud-based LoRA training. [Tinker](https://www.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/) is the default reference path, and MinT can be enabled through a separate compatibility package when needed.

## 🤖 Key Features

### **One-click deployment**
Configure once with `metaclaw setup`, then `metaclaw start` brings up the proxy, injects skills, and wires your chosen personal agent (OpenClaw, CoPaw, or IronClaw) automatically. No manual shell scripts needed.

### **Three operating modes**

| Mode | Default | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `skills_only` | | Proxy your LLM API. Skills injected and auto-summarized after each session. No GPU/Tinker required. |
| `rl` | | Skills + RL training (GRPO). Trains immediately when a batch is full. Optional OPD for teacher distillation. |
| `madmax` | ✅ | Skills + RL + smart scheduler. RL weight updates only run during sleep/idle/meeting windows. |

### **Asynchronous by design**
Serving, reward modeling, and training are fully decoupled. The agent continues responding while scoring and optimization run in parallel.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install -e .                        # skills_only mode (lightweight)
pip install -e ".[rl]"                  # + RL training support (torch, transformers, tinker)
pip install -e ".[evolve]"              # + skill evolution via OpenAI-compatible LLM
pip install -e ".[scheduler]"           # + Google Calendar integration for scheduler
pip install -e ".[rl,evolve,scheduler]" # recommended for full RL + scheduler setup
```

If you want to run `rl.backend=mint`, install the MinT compatibility package separately in the same environment, for example [`mindlab-toolkit`](https://github.com/MindLab-Research/mindlab-toolkit). MetaClaw keeps that dependency out of the default package so RL users can choose Tinker or MinT explicitly.

### 2. Configure

```bash
metaclaw setup
```

The interactive wizard will ask you to:
1. **Choose your personal agent** — `openclaw`, `copaw`, `ironclaw`, `picoclaw`, `zeroclaw`, `nanoclaw`, `nemoclaw`, or `none` (MetaClaw will auto-configure it on start)
2. **Choose your LLM provider** — Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, or custom
3. **Enter your API key** and optionally enable RL training

MetaClaw's RL path can switch explicitly between `tinker` and `mint`. `auto` is the recommended default and will still infer MinT from Mint-like credentials or base URLs when the MinT package is installed.

**Tinker**:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.backend tinker
metaclaw config rl.api_key sk-...
metaclaw config rl.model moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5
```

**MinT**:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.backend mint
metaclaw config rl.api_key sk-mint-...
metaclaw config rl.base_url https://mint.macaron.xin/
metaclaw config rl.model Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
```

Legacy aliases `rl.tinker_api_key` and `rl.tinker_base_url` are still accepted for backward compatibility.

### 3. Start

```bash
metaclaw start
```

That's it. MetaClaw starts the proxy, automatically configures your chosen personal agent to use it, and restarts the gateway. Open your agent and start chatting — skills are injected at every turn, and the session is automatically summarized into new skills when you're done.

---

## 🦞 Multi-Claw Support

MetaClaw works as a transparent proxy in front of any personal agent that supports an OpenAI-compatible LLM backend. The `claw_type` setting tells MetaClaw which agent to auto-configure when it starts.

| `claw_type` | Agent | What MetaClaw does on `start` |
|---|---|---|
| `openclaw` | [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) | Runs `openclaw config set models.providers.metaclaw …` + `gateway restart` |
| `copaw` | [CoPaw](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw) | Patches `~/.copaw/config.json` → `models.default` → `openai_compatible` pointing at the proxy port. CoPaw's ConfigWatcher hot-reloads automatically. |
| `ironclaw` | [IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) | Patches `~/.ironclaw/.env` → `LLM_BACKEND=openai_compatible` + `LLM_BASE_URL/MODEL/API_KEY`. Runs `ironclaw service restart`. |
| `picoclaw` | [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) | Injects a `metaclaw` entry into `~/.picoclaw/config.json` `model_list` and sets it as the default model. Runs `picoclaw gateway restart`. |
| `zeroclaw` | [ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) | Patches `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml` → `provider = "openai-compatible"` + `base_url/model/api_key`. Runs `zeroclaw service restart`. |
| `nanoclaw` | [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) | Patches nanoclaw's `.env` → `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing at the proxy's `/v1/messages` Anthropic-compatible endpoint. Restarts via `launchctl` (macOS) or `systemctl --user` (Linux). |
| `nemoclaw` | [NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) | Registers a `metaclaw` provider in OpenShell via `openshell provider create` and sets it as the active inference route via `openshell inference set`. Persists config to `~/.nemoclaw/config.json`. |
| `none` | — | Skips auto-configuration. Point your agent at the proxy manually. |

### Setup

Pick your agent during `metaclaw setup` (the first question in the wizard):

```
Personal agent to configure (openclaw/copaw/ironclaw/picoclaw/zeroclaw/nanoclaw/nemoclaw/none) [openclaw]:
```

Or set it directly at any time:

```bash
metaclaw config claw_type copaw      # switch to CoPaw
metaclaw config claw_type ironclaw   # switch to IronClaw
metaclaw config claw_type picoclaw   # switch to PicoClaw
metaclaw config claw_type zeroclaw   # switch to ZeroClaw
metaclaw config claw_type nanoclaw   # switch to NanoClaw
metaclaw config claw_type nemoclaw   # switch to NemoClaw
metaclaw config claw_type none       # manual / custom agent
```

Then run `metaclaw start` as usual — the proxy comes up and the chosen agent is wired automatically.

### Manual wiring (claw_type=none)

Point any OpenAI-compatible client at the MetaClaw proxy:

```
base_url: http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1
api_key:  metaclaw          # or whatever proxy.api_key is set to
model:    <your model id>
```

For Anthropic-native clients (e.g. the Claude SDK or NanoClaw's credential proxy), use the Anthropic-compatible endpoint instead:

```
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: http://127.0.0.1:30000
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  metaclaw
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration lives in `~/.metaclaw/config.yaml`, created by `metaclaw setup`.

**CLI commands:**

```
metaclaw setup                  # Interactive first-time configuration wizard
metaclaw start                  # Start MetaClaw (default: madmax mode)
metaclaw start --mode rl        # Force RL mode (no scheduler) for this session
metaclaw start --mode skills_only  # Force skills-only mode for this session
metaclaw stop                   # Stop a running MetaClaw instance
metaclaw status                 # Check proxy health, running mode, and scheduler state
metaclaw config show            # View current configuration

## 💪 Skills Mode

**`metaclaw start --mode skills_only`**

The lightest mode. No GPU, no RL backend needed. MetaClaw places your LLM behind a proxy that injects relevant skills at every turn, then auto-summarizes new skills after each conversation.

For OpenAI-compatible custom providers, set `llm.api_base` to the full chat API base (usually ending in `/v1`, for example `https://your-gateway.example/v1`). In `skills_only` mode, MetaClaw reuses that same endpoint for prompt compression and related helper LLM calls unless you configure a separate evolver endpoint.

Skills are short Markdown instructions stored in `~/.metaclaw/skills/` as individual `SKILL.md` files. The library grows automatically with your usage.

To pre-load the built-in skill bank (40+ skills across coding, security, agentic tasks, etc.):

```bash
cp -r memory_data/skills/* ~/.metaclaw/skills/
```

---

## 🔬 RL Mode

**`metaclaw start --mode rl`**

Everything in Skills Mode, plus continuous RL fine-tuning from live conversations. Each conversation turn is tokenized and submitted as a training sample. A judge LLM (PRM) scores responses asynchronously, and a Tinker-compatible backend (Tinker cloud or MinT) runs LoRA fine-tuning with hot-swapped weights.

**Tinker**:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.backend tinker
metaclaw config rl.api_key sk-...
metaclaw config rl.model moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5
metaclaw config rl.prm_url https://api.openai.com/v1
metaclaw config rl.prm_api_key sk-...
metaclaw start --mode rl
```

**MinT**:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.backend mint
metaclaw config rl.api_key sk-mint-...
metaclaw config rl.base_url https://mint.macaron.xin/
metaclaw config rl.model Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
metaclaw config rl.prm_url https://api.openai.com/v1
metaclaw config rl.prm_api_key sk-...
metaclaw start --mode rl
```

A dedicated evolver LLM also extracts new skills from failed episodes, feeding them back into the skill library.

**Programmatic rollout** (no OpenClaw TUI needed): set `openclaw_env_data_dir` to a directory of JSONL task files:

```json
{"task_id": "task_1", "instruction": "Register the webhook at https://example.com/hook"}
```

### On-Policy Distillation (OPD)

OPD is an optional add-on for RL Mode. It distills a larger teacher model into the student on-policy: the student generates responses as usual, and the teacher provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. A KL penalty steers the student toward the teacher's distribution.

```bash
metaclaw config opd.enabled true
metaclaw config opd.teacher_url http://localhost:8082/v1
metaclaw config opd.teacher_model Qwen/Qwen3-32B
metaclaw config opd.kl_penalty_coef 1.0
```

The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang). OPD can be combined with PRM scoring, both run asynchronously. See `examples/run_conversation_opd.py` and `scripts/run_openclaw_tinker_opd.sh`.

---

## 🧠 MadMax Mode (Default)

**`metaclaw start`**

Everything in RL Mode, plus a meta-learning scheduler that defers weight updates to user-inactive windows so the agent is never interrupted during active use. This is the default mode.

The RL weight hot-swap step pauses the agent for several minutes. Instead of training immediately when a batch is full (like RL Mode does), MadMax waits for an appropriate window.

Three conditions trigger an update window (any one is sufficient):

- **Sleep hours**: configurable start/end time (e.g., 23:00 to 07:00)
- **Keyboard inactivity**: triggers after N minutes of idle time
- **Google Calendar events**: detects meetings so updates can run while you're away

```bash
metaclaw config scheduler.sleep_start "23:00"
metaclaw config scheduler.sleep_end   "07:00"
metaclaw config scheduler.idle_threshold_minutes 30

# Optional: Google Calendar integration
pip install -e ".[scheduler]"
metaclaw config scheduler.calendar.enabled true
metaclaw config scheduler.calendar.credentials_path ~/.metaclaw/client_secrets.json
```

If the user returns mid-update, the partial batch is saved and resumed at the next window.

Each `ConversationSample` is tagged with a `skill_generation` version. When skill evolution bumps the generation, the RL buffer is flushed so only post-evolution samples are used for gradient updates (MAML support/query set separation).
