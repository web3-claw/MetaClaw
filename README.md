## 📖 Overview

**MetaClaw turns live conversations into continuous training data — automatically.**
Just talk to your agent as usual, and MetaClaw handles the learning loop behind the scenes.

It places your model behind an OpenAI-compatible proxy that intercepts interactions from OpenClaw, injects relevant skills at each step, and can optionally perform continuous fine-tuning through Tinker Cloud RL. Updated weights are hot-swapped seamlessly without interrupting the service.

There is no need to maintain a dedicated GPU cluster. MetaClaw works with any OpenAI-compatible LLM API out of the box, and optionally integrates **Kimi-K2.5** (1T MoE) via [Tinker](https://www.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/) for cloud-based LoRA training.

## 🤖 Key Features

### **One-click deployment**
Configure once with `metaclaw setup`, then `metaclaw start` brings up the proxy, injects skills, and wires OpenClaw automatically. No manual shell scripts needed.

### **Two operating modes**

| Mode | Default | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `skills_only` | ✅ | Proxy → your LLM API. Skills injected, auto-summarized after each session. No GPU/Tinker required. |
| `rl` | off | Proxy → Tinker cloud RL. Full training loop with PRM scoring and skill evolution from failures. |

### **Skill injection**
At every turn, MetaClaw retrieves the most relevant skill instructions and injects them into the agent's system prompt. Immediate behavior improvement without retraining.

### **Automatic skill summarization**
After each conversation, the same LLM you're already using analyzes the session and distills new skills automatically. With RL enabled, a dedicated judge model extracts skills from failed episodes.

### **No GPU cluster required**
In `skills_only` mode, only a network connection is needed. RL training is offloaded to Tinker cloud.

### **Two learning modes**
MetaClaw supports both:
- **RL (GRPO)** for learning from implicit feedback signals
- **On-Policy Distillation (OPD)** for distilling a larger teacher model into the student on-policy

In OPD mode, the student generates responses as usual, and a teacher model provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. The teacher logprobs are passed to the loss function (e.g., `cispo`) so the student learns to match the teacher's distribution. The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang).

### **Asynchronous by design**
Serving, reward modeling, and training are fully decoupled. The agent continues responding while scoring and optimization run in parallel.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install -e .            # skills_only mode (lightweight)
pip install -e ".[rl]"      # + RL training support (torch, transformers, tinker)
pip install -e ".[evolve]"  # + skill evolution via OpenAI-compatible LLM
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
metaclaw setup
```

The interactive wizard will ask you to choose your LLM provider (Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, or custom), enter your API key, and optionally enable RL training.

### 3. Start

```bash
metaclaw start
```

That's it. MetaClaw starts the proxy, automatically configures OpenClaw to use it, and restarts the gateway. Open OpenClaw and start chatting — skills are injected at every turn, and the session is automatically summarized into new skills when you're done.

## 🛠️ CLI Reference

```
metaclaw setup              # Interactive first-time configuration wizard
metaclaw start              # Start MetaClaw (proxy + optional RL)
metaclaw start --mode rl    # Force RL mode for this session
metaclaw stop               # Stop a running MetaClaw instance
metaclaw status             # Check proxy health and running mode
metaclaw config show        # View current configuration
metaclaw config KEY VALUE   # Set a config value
```

**Common config keys:**

```bash
metaclaw config rl.enabled true           # Enable RL training
metaclaw config rl.tinker_api_key sk-...  # Set Tinker key
metaclaw config skills.auto_evolve false  # Disable auto skill summarization
metaclaw config proxy.port 31000          # Change proxy port
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration lives in `~/.metaclaw/config.yaml`, created by `metaclaw setup`.

```yaml
mode: skills_only          # "skills_only" | "rl"

llm:
  provider: kimi            # kimi | qwen | openai | minimax | custom
  model_id: moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5
  api_base: https://api.moonshot.cn/v1
  api_key: sk-...

proxy:
  port: 30000

skills:
  enabled: true
  dir: ~/.metaclaw/skills   # your skill library
  retrieval_mode: template  # template | embedding
  top_k: 6
  task_specific_top_k: 10   # cap task-specific skills (default 10)
  auto_evolve: true         # auto-summarize skills after each session

rl:
  enabled: false            # set to true to enable RL training
  model: moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5
  tinker_api_key: ""

  prm_model: gpt-5.2
  prm_api_key: ""
  lora_rank: 32
  batch_size: 4
  resume_from_ckpt: ""      # optional checkpoint path to resume training
  evolver_api_base: ""      # leave empty to reuse llm.api_base
  evolver_api_key: ""
  evolver_model: gpt-5.2

opd:

  teacher_url: ""           # teacher model base URL (OpenAI-compatible /v1/completions)
  teacher_model: ""         # teacher model name (e.g., Qwen/Qwen3-32B)
  teacher_api_key: ""       # teacher model API key
  kl_penalty_coef: 1.0      # KL penalty coefficient for OPD

max_context_tokens: 20000   # prompt token cap before truncation
```

## 💪 Skills

Skills are short Markdown instructions injected into the agent's system prompt at each turn. They live in your skills directory (`~/.metaclaw/skills/` by default), organized as individual `SKILL.md` files.

**Skill auto-summarization** runs after each conversation. The LLM you configured analyzes what happened and generates new skills automatically. No manual curation needed — the library grows with your usage.

To pre-load the built-in skill bank (40+ skills across coding, security, agentic tasks, etc.):

```bash
cp -r memory_data/skills/* ~/.metaclaw/skills/
```

---

## 🔬 Advanced: RL Mode

Enable RL training to continuously fine-tune the model from live conversations:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.enabled true
metaclaw config rl.tinker_api_key sk-...
metaclaw config rl.prm_url https://api.openai.com/v1
metaclaw config rl.prm_api_key sk-...
metaclaw start
```

In RL mode:
- Each conversation turn is tokenized and submitted as a training sample
- A judge LLM (PRM) scores responses asynchronously
- Tinker cloud runs LoRA fine-tuning; updated weights are hot-swapped every `batch_size` samples
- A dedicated evolver LLM extracts new skills from failed episodes

**Programmatic rollout** (no OpenClaw TUI needed): set `openclaw_env_data_dir` to a directory of JSONL task files:

```json
{"task_id": "task_1", "instruction": "Register the webhook at https://example.com/hook"}
```

---

## 🔬 Advanced: OPD Mode

On-Policy Distillation (OPD) lets you distill a larger teacher model into the student while it trains on-policy. The student generates responses as usual; the teacher provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. A KL penalty steers the student toward the teacher's distribution.

```bash
metaclaw config opd.enabled true
metaclaw config opd.teacher_url http://localhost:8082/v1
metaclaw config opd.teacher_model Qwen/Qwen3-32B
metaclaw config opd.kl_penalty_coef 1.0
metaclaw start --mode rl
```

The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang). OPD can be combined with PRM scoring — both run asynchronously.

See `examples/run_conversation_opd.py` for a programmatic example and `scripts/run_openclaw_tinker_opd.sh` for a ready-made launch script.
