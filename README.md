## 📖 Overview

**MetaClaw turns live conversations into continuous training data — automatically.**
Just talk to your agent as usual, and MetaClaw handles the learning loop behind the scenes.

It wraps your model behind an OpenAI-compatible proxy, intercepts interactions from OpenClaw, injects relevant skills at every turn, and optionally fine-tunes the model continuously via Tinker cloud RL. Updated weights are hot-swapped with no service interruption.

There is no need to maintain a dedicated GPU cluster. MetaClaw works with any OpenAI-compatible LLM API out of the box, and optionally integrates **Kimi-K2.5** (~200B MoE) via [Tinker](https://www.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/) for cloud-based LoRA training.

## 🤖 Key Features

### **One-click deployment**
Configure once with `metaclaw setup`, then `metaclaw start` brings up the proxy, injects skills, and wires OpenClaw automatically. No manual shell scripts needed.

### **Two operating modes**

| Mode | Default | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `skills_only` | ✅ | Proxy → your LLM API. Skills injected, auto-summarized after each session. No GPU/Tinker required. |
| `rl` | off | Proxy → Tinker cloud RL. Full training loop with PRM scoring and skill evolution from failures. |

### **Meta-learning update scheduler** *(v0.3, RL mode only)*

Slow RL weight updates (which pause the agent for several minutes) are now gated by a smart scheduler inspired by the MAML meta-learning framework:

- **Inner loop (fast)** — skill files are updated immediately after each session, always on
- **Outer loop (slow)** — RL gradient updates only run during user-inactive windows

Three conditions trigger an update window (any one is sufficient):

| Trigger | How it works |
|---------|-------------|
| Sleep hours | Configurable start/end time (e.g. `23:00–07:00`) |
| System idle | User has been away from keyboard for N minutes (macOS: `ioreg`; Linux: `xprintidle`) |
| Google Calendar | Current time falls inside a calendar event — user is in a meeting |

The agent continues running and serving requests throughout; only the expensive `save_weights` step is deferred to idle windows.

### **Skill injection**
At every turn, MetaClaw retrieves the most relevant skill instructions and injects them into the agent's system prompt. Immediate behavior improvement without retraining.

### **Automatic skill summarization**
After each conversation, the same LLM you're already using analyzes the session and distills new skills automatically. With RL enabled, a dedicated judge model extracts skills from failed episodes.

### **No GPU cluster required**
In `skills_only` mode, only a network connection is needed. RL training is offloaded to Tinker cloud.

### **Two learning modes**
MetaClaw supports both:
- **RL (GRPO)** for learning from implicit feedback signals
- **On-Policy Distillation (OPD)** for distilling a larger teacher model into the student on-policy

In OPD mode, the student generates responses as usual, and a teacher model provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. The teacher logprobs are passed to the loss function (e.g., `cispo`) so the student learns to match the teacher's distribution. The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang).

### **Asynchronous by design**
Serving, reward modeling, and training are fully decoupled. The agent continues responding while scoring and optimization run in parallel.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install -e .                        # skills_only mode (lightweight)
pip install -e ".[rl]"                  # + RL training support (torch, transformers, tinker)
pip install -e ".[evolve]"              # + skill evolution via OpenAI-compatible LLM
pip install -e ".[scheduler]"           # + Google Calendar integration for scheduler
pip install -e ".[rl,evolve,scheduler]" # recommended for full RL + scheduler setup
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
metaclaw setup
```

The interactive wizard will ask you to choose your LLM provider (Kimi, Qwen, or custom), enter your API key, and optionally enable RL training.

### 3. Start

```bash
metaclaw start
```

That's it. MetaClaw starts the proxy, automatically configures OpenClaw to use it, and restarts the gateway. Open OpenClaw and start chatting — skills are injected at every turn, and the session is automatically summarized into new skills when you're done.

## 💪 Skills

Skills are short Markdown instructions injected into the agent's system prompt at each turn. They live in your skills directory (`~/.metaclaw/skills/` by default), organized as individual `SKILL.md` files.

**Skill auto-summarization** runs after each conversation. The LLM you configured analyzes what happened and generates new skills automatically. No manual curation needed — the library grows with your usage.

To pre-load the built-in skill bank (40+ skills across coding, security, agentic tasks, etc.):

```bash
cp -r memory_data/skills/* ~/.metaclaw/skills/
```

---

## 🔬 Advanced: RL Mode

Enable RL training to continuously fine-tune the model from live conversations:

```bash
metaclaw config rl.enabled true
metaclaw config rl.tinker_api_key sk-...
metaclaw config rl.prm_url https://api.openai.com/v1
metaclaw config rl.prm_api_key sk-...
metaclaw start
```

In RL mode:
- Each conversation turn is tokenized and submitted as a training sample
- A judge LLM (PRM) scores responses asynchronously
- Tinker cloud runs LoRA fine-tuning; updated weights are hot-swapped every `batch_size` samples
- A dedicated evolver LLM extracts new skills from failed episodes

**Programmatic rollout** (no OpenClaw TUI needed): set `openclaw_env_data_dir` to a directory of JSONL task files:

```json
{"task_id": "task_1", "instruction": "Register the webhook at https://example.com/hook"}
```

---

## 🔬 Advanced: OPD Mode

On-Policy Distillation (OPD) lets you distill a larger teacher model into the student while it trains on-policy. The student generates responses as usual; the teacher provides per-token log-probabilities on those same responses. A KL penalty steers the student toward the teacher's distribution.

```bash
metaclaw config opd.enabled true
metaclaw config opd.teacher_url http://localhost:8082/v1
metaclaw config opd.teacher_model Qwen/Qwen3-32B
metaclaw config opd.kl_penalty_coef 1.0
metaclaw start --mode rl
```

The teacher must be served behind an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` endpoint (e.g., vLLM, SGLang). OPD can be combined with PRM scoring — both run asynchronously.

See `examples/run_conversation_opd.py` for a programmatic example and `scripts/run_openclaw_tinker_opd.sh` for a ready-made launch script.

## 🧠 Advanced: Meta-Learning Scheduler (v0.3)

### Motivation

In RL mode, `save_weights_and_get_sampling_client` (the weight hot-swap step) pauses the agent for several minutes. Running this during active usage degrades the user experience. v0.3 introduces a scheduler that defers this step to idle windows.

### How to enable

Run `metaclaw setup` and answer yes to the scheduler questions, or set config values directly:

```bash
# Enable scheduler
metaclaw config scheduler.enabled true
metaclaw config scheduler.sleep_start "23:00"
metaclaw config scheduler.sleep_end   "07:00"
metaclaw config scheduler.idle_threshold_minutes 30

# Optional: Google Calendar (detect meeting windows)
pip install -e ".[scheduler]"
metaclaw config scheduler.calendar.enabled true
metaclaw config scheduler.calendar.credentials_path ~/.metaclaw/client_secrets.json
metaclaw setup   # triggers Google Calendar device flow OAuth
```

Once running in RL mode, you can monitor the scheduler:

```bash
metaclaw status                 # shows scheduler state inline
metaclaw scheduler status       # detailed state + sleep window + idle threshold
metaclaw scheduler next-window  # explains when the next window will open
```

### Architecture

The scheduler runs as an `asyncio` task alongside the trainer, checking conditions every 60 seconds:

```
IDLE_WAIT ──(sleep / idle / meeting)──► WINDOW_OPEN
WINDOW_OPEN ──(trainer acks)──────────► UPDATING
UPDATING ──(user becomes active)──────► PAUSING
PAUSING ──(trainer stops)─────────────► IDLE_WAIT
```

When a window opens, the trainer collects a batch and runs `forward_backward → optim_step → save_weights`. If the user returns mid-collection, the partial batch is saved and resumed at the next window.

### MAML support/query set separation

MetaClaw v0.3 also fixes a subtle data leakage issue present in earlier versions:

- **Inner loop** (skill evolution): analyzes failed samples and generates new skill files
- **Outer loop** (RL update): updates model weights via gradient descent

If the same failed samples are used for *both* loops, the RL gradient receives a stale negative signal for behavior that the new skills have already corrected. This is equivalent to violating the MAML principle that support set ≠ query set.

**Fix**: Each `ConversationSample` is tagged with a `skill_generation` version number. When skill evolution adds new skills and bumps the generation counter, the RL sample buffer is immediately cleared. Only samples collected *after* the new skills are in place are used for the RL gradient update.

```
Session 1, 2, 3  →  skill evolution fires  →  new skills written
                                               ↓
                              stale samples discarded from RL buffer
                                               ↓
Session 4, 5, 6  →  fresh samples (with new skills injected)  →  RL update
```
